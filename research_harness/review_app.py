"""DEPRECATED — kept as a thin shim for backward compatibility.

The unified entry is `research_harness.review` (CLI: `research-review`).
This module forwards `python -m research_harness.review_app` and the
`generate_review` import to the new entry. Existing skills that call
`python -m research_harness.review_app paper.pdf --venue X [--draft d]`
still work.

New code should import:
    from research_harness.review import review
or run:
    research-review paper.pdf --venue X
