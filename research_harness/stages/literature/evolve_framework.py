    """Revise the topic framework based on accumulated evidence.

    Refactor the topic tree. Evidence to consider:
    - Current framework (what we have now)
    - All annotated papers (topic_path per paper + contribution_summary)
    - All surveys (TOC + key claims)
    - Recent audit tail (what's been changing recently — don't flip-flop)

    Decide what `delta` operations are justified. Available ops:
    - `add`    { "op":"add",    "path":"parent/new_leaf", "node":{...} }
    - `merge`  { "op":"merge",  "paths":["a","b"], "new_path":"merged", "new_node":{...} }
    - `split`  { "op":"split",  "path":"a/too_broad", "new_children":[ {...}, {...} ] }
    - `rename` { "op":"rename", "path":"old", "new_name":"better_name" }
    - `drop`   { "op":"drop",   "path":"a/empty_or_redundant" }

    When to apply each:
    - `add`:    orphan papers cluster around a missing topic; a survey's branch
                has no counterpart in our tree.
    - `merge`:  two siblings attract the same papers; their descriptions overlap.
    - `split`:  a node has >~15 papers of visibly distinct sub-methods.
    - `rename`: current name misleads or misaligns with field terminology.
    - `drop`:   node has 0 papers and no strong survey support.

    Be CONSERVATIVE. Prefer no change to churn. Only apply ops you can justify
    from the evidence. Do not rename for taste alone.

    Workflow:
    1. Scan orphan papers. Cluster them. If a cluster is coherent and >=3
       papers, propose an `add` (or a `split` on an existing broad node).
    2. Scan sibling overlap. If two sibling topics share >50% of their papers'
       contribution domain, propose a `merge`.
    3. Scan oversized leaves. If >=15 papers, propose `split`.
    4. Flag empty leaves (0 papers and no survey mention) for `drop`.
    5. Apply the operations in order; compute the resulting tree.
    6. For papers whose old `topic_path` is affected, propose a new placement
       (the orchestrator will update them; do NOT re-annotate contribution).

    7. Return ONE JSON object, nothing else:
    ```json
    {
      "new_framework": { ...tree... },
      "deltas": [ { "op": "...", ... }, ... ],
      "paper_relocations": [
        { "paper_id": "...", "old_path": "a/b", "new_path": "a/c" }
      ],
      "rationale": "2-6 sentences justifying each op by evidence",
      "stable": false
    }
    ```

    - Set `stable: true` if NO non-trivial op was justified (no add/merge/
      split/drop; rename-only counts as "stable" for convergence purposes).
    - `paper_relocations` only lists papers whose path literally changed.

    Rules:
    - Output ONLY the JSON.
    - `new_framework` must be a complete, consistent tree (not a patch).
    - If `deltas` is empty, `new_framework` equals the input framework.
    - The orchestrator already persists state — do NOT write extra files.

    Taxonomy design axioms — re-check these every revision; conservatism
    does NOT excuse keeping a structurally broken tree:

    1. SEPARATE METHOD AXES FROM CROSS-CUTTING CONCERNS.
       Root-level children split into (a) orthogonal METHOD DESIGN AXES
       (the choices a practitioner makes — source / granularity / objective
       / data-collection / etc.) and (b) CROSS-CUTTING concerns (theory,
       shared infrastructure, failure modes). They cannot share a level.
       If the current tree mixes them at the root, propose a `merge` /
       `split` / restructuring delta to fix it.

    2. SAME-LEVEL ABSTRACTION CONSISTENCY.
       Children of one parent must answer the same question. If they don't,
       restructure (merge mismatched siblings under a new umbrella, or
       move them under the parent they actually belong to).

    3. NO SIBLING OVERLAP.
       If a paper would naturally land under two sibling nodes, those
       siblings are not orthogonal. Propose a `merge`. The clearest signal
       is: a single paper's contribution_summary maps to multiple sibling
       paths in `paper_relocations`. That is the trigger to consolidate,
       not to file the paper twice.

    4. NO STARVED OR EMPTY NODES.
       A leaf with 0 papers AND no direct survey TOC entry → propose
       `drop`. A leaf with 1-2 papers and no survey TOC carve-out →
       propose `merge` into its parent or a broader sibling. Do not keep
       nodes solely to signal "this sub-area exists in principle".
