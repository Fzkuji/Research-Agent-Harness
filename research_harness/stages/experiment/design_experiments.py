    """Design a complete experiment plan for a research idea.

    Design a rigorous experiment plan. It must include:
    1. Research Questions (RQ1, RQ2, RQ3...)
    2. Datasets: which ones, why, train/val/test splits
    3. Baselines: recent methods (within 2 years), justify each
    4. Evaluation Metrics: which metrics, why they're appropriate
    5. Ablation Study: which components to ablate
    6. Implementation Details: framework, hardware, hyperparameter ranges
    7. Expected Experiment Types:
       - Overall Performance (all datasets × all baselines)
       - Ablation Study (remove key modules)
       - Parameter Analysis (vary hyperparameters)
       - Efficiency Study (time/space)
       - Case Study / Visualization

    Each experiment should map to a specific research question.
    Be specific about what to measure and how to interpret results.
