"""Wrapper around `subprocess.run` for codex CLI calls with retry on
transient failures.

Codex CLI is observed to occasionally exit with rc=-9 (SIGKILL, usually
OS OOM killer or codex's own watchdog) on long prompts. These failures
are transient — same prompt usually succeeds on the second try. Wrap
the call once here so every codex invocation in the review pipeline
gets the same retry behavior.
